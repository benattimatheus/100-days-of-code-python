    <li><a href="https://github.com/benattimatheus/100DaysPython/blob/main/Project3ENTreasureIsland.ipynb">03. Treasure Island (English)</a> - Little choice game using conditions</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/benattimatheus/100DaysPython/blob/main/Projeto3PTBRIlhaDoTesouro.ipynb">03. Ilha do Tesouro (PortuguÃªs-Brasil)</a> - Jogo de escolha usando as conditions</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/benattimatheus/100DaysPython/blob/main/Project4RockPaperScissors.ipynb">04. Rock Paper Scissors</a> - Building this famous game using the concepts of lists, conditions and randomization</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/benattimatheus/100DaysPython/blob/main/Project5PasswordGenerator.ipynb">05. Password Generator</a> - Created an random password generator that contains letters, symbols and numbers in a random order. The project was built using the concepts of randomization, lists and for loops</li>
